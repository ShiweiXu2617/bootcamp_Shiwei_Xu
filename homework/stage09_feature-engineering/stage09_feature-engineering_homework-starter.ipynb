    "A single day’s trading volume may reflect random noise (e.g., news events or market anomalies), and relying only on raw daily volume could make the model unstable. \n",
    "By using a 7-day rolling average, this feature smooths out short-term fluctuations and captures the underlying trend in market activity. \n",
    "This helps the model better identify sustained increases or decreases in trading interest, which can be more predictive of price movements than noisy daily values.\n"
